Sudoku Solver

A Console app that will solve a Sudoku puzzle with the press of a button.
Rather than input 1-9 in each empty cell, this will solve the puzzle by inputting a value and also check that there is no duplicate or 
same number in the row/column or block. It will backtrack to the erroring number and try a different one and continue.
